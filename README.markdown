# Twig Macros for Craft

I absolutely love the ability to create macros while working in Craft CMS. While you don't necessarily need Craft to work with many of these macros, specific ones may get added in the future. Enjoy!

## Current Macros

* abbrStateName - given a full US state name this returns the appreviated name
* daterange - give two dates within the same month, this returns a formatted date range
* fullStateName - given an appreviated US state this returns the full state name
* link_to_if - given a condition this wraps a block within a link if the condition is met
* ordinalNum - given a number this returns the number with its ordinal suffix: 1 => 1st
* randomString - generates a random string of numbers and letters given a specific length
